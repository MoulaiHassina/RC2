%Searching the position of $\beta$ in oldpot so that to replace it by $\alpha$. 
%To do so, we compute the distribution of parents and we search the position of the values
%inferior to $\alpha$ and we place them in i and j which are vectors containing row and column indices, respectively. 
%For instance if i=[1 2 1] j=[1 1 2] then the instances 11, 21, 12 of parents are inconsistent. 

%Then, in order to search beta (to replace it by alpha) for the instance 21 of parents, we start in
%oldpot at position [line, column]=[2, 1] and we look for the
%maximum value for this instance in oldpot (i.e inter.T(inconsistent_index(i)). The maximization is
%always performed in the same line (i.e 2). Indeed, we maximize on
%the child which is always in the last position (due to the
%topological order) but we should jump up in columns by the
%possible configurations of parents in the same line (i.e
%column_parents).
