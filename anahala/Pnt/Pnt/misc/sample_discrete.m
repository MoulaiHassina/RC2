function M = sample_discrete(prob, r, c)
% SAMPLE_DISCRETE Like the built in 'rand', except we draw from a non-uniform discrete distrib.
% M = sample_discrete(prob, r, c)
%
% Example: sample_discrete([0.8 0.2], 1, 10) generates a row vector of 10 random integers from {1,2},
% where the prob. of being 1 is 0.8 and the prob of being 2 is 0.2.

if nargin == 1
  r = 1; c = 1;
elseif nargin == 2
  c == r;
end

% this speedup is due to Peter Acklam
