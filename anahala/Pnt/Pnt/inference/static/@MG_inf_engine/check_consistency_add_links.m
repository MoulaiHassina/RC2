%This procedure ensures the global consistency by computing from each cluster having at least one
%parent the potential of its parents (i.e. \emph{pot\_parents}).
%\\ Then,  we check if this distribution contains some values less
%than \emph{alpha-stable} using \emph{check\_consistency\_cluster}.
%If so,  then the cluster is inconsistent. In this case we should
%first test the following situations before dropping its
%inconsistency:
%- if the degree $\beta$ exists in the parents of $C_i$ (this test is performed using \emph{check\_beta}),
%- if the parents of the treated cluster are already linked in the DAG (i.e. \emph{all\_linked}=0) (from the construction or from additional links of a previous step).

%If none of these cases is true, then we should modify the
%inconsistent cluster as follows:
%* Modification of the potential of the inconsistent cluster (replace \emph{beta} by \emph{alpha-stable} using \emph{modify\_pot})
%* Retrieval of \emph{beta} by adding links between parents of\emph{i} (i.e. \emph{ps}) using \emph{add\_links}. To do so, we
%choose the parent in the maximum position (i.e.
%\emph{parent\_index}) and transform the other parents (i.e.
%\emph{rest\_parents}) as its parents in its corresponding cluster
%(i.e. \emph{q}) so that to respect the topological order.
