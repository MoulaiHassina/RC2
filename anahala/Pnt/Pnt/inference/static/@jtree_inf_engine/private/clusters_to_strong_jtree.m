% Here is a definition of a strong jtree from Jensen et al. 1994:
% "A junction tree is said to be strong if it has at least one distinguished cluster R,
% called a strong root, s.t. for each pair (C1,C2) of adjacent clusters in the tree,
% with C1 closer to R than C2, there exists and ordering of [the nodes below] C2
% that respects [the partial order] and with the vertices of the separator C1 intersect C2
% preceeding the vertices [below C2] of C2 \ C1."
%          
% For details, see
% - Jensen, Jensen and Dittmer, "From influence diagrams to junction trees", UAI 94.
%
% MTG is the moralized, triangulated graph.
% elim_order is the elimination ordering used to compute MTG.


% Warning: this is a very naive implementation of the algorithm in Jensen et al.

n = length(elim_order);
alpha(elim_order) = n:-1:1;
% alpha(u) = i if we eliminate u at step n-i+1
% i.e., vertices with higher alpha numbers are eliminated before vertices with lower numbers.
% e.g., from the Jensen et al paper
% node a=1 eliminated at step 6, so alpha(a)=16-6+1=11.
% alpha = [11 1 2 10 9 3 4 7 5 8 13 12 6 16 15 14]


% We sort the clusters in order of increasing index. The index of a cluster C is defined as follows.
% Let lower = {u | alpha(u) < alpha(v)}, and
% let v in C be the highest-numbered vertex s.t. the vertices in W = lower intersect C
% have a common neighbor u in U, where U = lower \ C.
% If such a v exists, define index(C) = alpha(v), otherwise, index(C) = 1.
% Intuitively, index(C) is the step in the elimination process at which C disappears.
