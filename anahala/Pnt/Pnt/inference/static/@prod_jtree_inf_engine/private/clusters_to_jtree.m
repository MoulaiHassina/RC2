% 
% A junction tree is a tree that satisfies the jtree property, which says:
% for each pair of clusters U,V with intersection S, all clusters on the path between U and V
% contain S. (This ensures that local propagation leads to global consistency.)
%
% We can create a junction tree by computing the maximal spanning tree of the junction graph.
% (The junction graph connects all clusters, and the weight of an edge (i,j) is
% |C(i) intersect C(j)|, where C(i) is the i'th cluster.)
%
% The best jtree is the maximal spanning tree which minimizes the sum of the costs on each edge,
% where cost(i,j) = w(C(i)) + w(C(j)), and w(C) is the weight of cluster C,
% which is the total number of values C can take on.
%
