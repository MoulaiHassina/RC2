% JTREE_INF_ENGINE Junction tree inference engine
% engine = jtree_inf_engine(pnet, obs_nodes, clusters, stages, onepass)
%
% 'obs_nodes' is an optional argument (default []) that specifies which nodes
% will probably be observed. Knowing this might result in a more efficient elimination
% ordering, since observed nodes can essentially be removed from the graph.
%
% 'clusters' is an optional argument (default []). If clusters{i}=S,
% then it is guaranteed to be possible to compute the marginal on the nodes in S.
% This is used by bk_inf_engine and structure learning.
%
% 'stages' is an optional argument (default {1:N}). It constrains the elimination ordering to a
% temporal sequence. This is used by jtree_unrolled_dbn_inf_engine.
%
% 'query' is an optional argument (default: []). If non-emtpy, the root of the junction tree
% will be a cluster that contains query. This is used by jtree_onepass.
