Conditional Probability Distributions are objects that support the
following methods (in addition to the constructor)

For junction tree and all other inference engines that use potentials:
- CPD_to_table
- CPD_to_cpot
- CPD_to_cgpot

For sampling and enumeration
- sample_CPD
- evaluate_CPD

Children of the discrete_CPD class (i.e., tabular and noisyor) just need to implement CPD_to_CPT
and can then inherit all of the above methods.

If CPD_to_tables is defined, it will be exploited by
fast_BK_inf_engine to evaluate long observation sequences in parallel.

For Pearl's algorithm
- compute_pi
- compute_lambda_msg
- CPD_to_CPT (for marginal_family only)

For learning
- adjustable_CPD
- update_ess
- reset_ess
- maximize_params
 (The last 3 functions are only needed if the node is adjustable)
